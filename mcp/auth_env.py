"""Centralized per-user .env resolution for every MCP server in this repo.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Claude Code spawns project-local (repo-relative) MCP stdio servers with their
``CLAUDE_*`` environment variables STRIPPED. So the per-user ``CLAUDE_ENV_FILE``
that Trinity sets on the agent process never reaches the MCP servers — every
server would fall back to the shared repo-root ``.env`` and read/write one
tenant's tokens into the file all tenants load (a cross-tenant credential leak).

Non-``CLAUDE_`` variables DO survive that hop, so Trinity exports
``TRINITY_ENV_DIR`` (the directory that holds this session's private ``.env``),
and every server resolves ``$TRINITY_ENV_DIR/.env`` through this one module.

Resolution order (first hit wins):
  1. ``$TRINITY_ENV_DIR/.env``   — per-user, set by Trinity (the normal path)
  2. ``$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE``        — non-stripped contexts (e.g. ``--mcp-config``)
  3. ``<repo-root>/.env``        — standalone CLI use outside Trinity
